### Controls
Default keybind is F, this is configurable in options. Default gamepad button is left stick click.

### Caveats
This will make your circuit tree look funky and may unlock moves you didn't already have, this mod is primarily for testing.

### Contributions
My thanks to Xenon for giving me the idea for the mod and the hack effect, and drawing the mod icon.
